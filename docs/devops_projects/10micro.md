## Introduction

This project demonstrates a complete, production-grade DevSecOps pipeline for deploying a cloud-native e-commerce application built on 11 different microservices written in multiple programming languages that communicate with each other over gRPC. The application was originally designed by Google Developers for the GKE but I have adapted it to be deployed on Amazon EKS or on any Kubernetes cluster.

The goal of this project is to design and implement an end-to-end DevOps workflow that automates:

* Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
* Continuous Integration (CI) using Jenkins for building, testing, scanning, and pushing container images
* Continuous Delivery (CD) using ArgoCD (GitOps) for seamless deployment to Amazon EKS
* Security and code quality checks with SonarQube, Gitleaks, and Trivy
* Monitoring and observability with Prometheus and Grafana

All components were carefully integrated to simulate a real-world DevOps environment, covering every stage from source code to production deployment.

The project highlights key modern DevOps practices, including:

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automating cloud resource provisioning with Terraform.
* **GitOps:** Managing Kubernetes deployments declaratively with ArgoCD.
* **CI/CD Automation:** Orchestrating multi-stage pipelines with Jenkins.
* **Cloud-Native Security:** Ensuring code quality, vulnerability management, and secrets detection.
* **Observability:** Collecting and visualizing system and application metrics with Prometheus and Grafana.

By the end of this project, youâ€™ll gain a detailed understanding of how each tool was implemented and how the entire pipeline works together to deliver a scalable, secure, and automated deployment workflow on AWS.

## Infrastructure Setup

---

### :simple-jenkins: Jenkins Server Setup

For the purpose of this project, we will be creating our Jenkins Server on an ec2 instance using Terraform as our IaC tool. The Jenkins server will also serve as our base server from where we will manage other infrastructures like  the EKS cluster.

I have included the link to my Github repo containing the Jenkins server Terraform script below.  

[Deploy a Jenkins Server on AWS using Terraform :simple-github: :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://github.com/opeyemitechpro/Terraform-Jenkins-CICD){: target="_blank" .md-button}
 

??? tip "Pre-requisites for the terraform script"

    You will need the following pre-requisites to run the terraform script on your local machine:

    - [x] An AWS account _([Get one here :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://aws.amazon.com/free/){: target="_blank" })_
    - [x] Terraform CLI installed on your local machine _([How to Install Terraform :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install){: target="_blank" })_
    - [x] Your AWS access key ID and secret access key _(learn how to get your AWS access keys [here :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html){: target="_blank" })_
    - [x] AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS access key ID and Secret access keys _(learn more about AWS CLI [here :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html){: target="_blank" })_ 

??? info "What does this terraform script do?"
    The Terrafom script will do the following:

    - [x] Provision an ec2 instance of type `t2.large` (You can easily set a different instance type in the `terraform.tfvars` file)
    - [x] Provision the ec2 instance in the default VPC
    - [x] Configure the security group to expose all the required ports for this project. The required ports are: `22, 25, 80, 443, 465, 8080, 9000 and 9100`. (The ports and their descriptions are listed in the `terraform.tfvars` file) 
    - [x] Create an AWS Key-Pair file and download the file unto your terraform working directory on your local machine _(the folder from where you initiated the terraform apply command)_
    - [x] Using the included Bash script _(in the user_data field)_, it will bootstrap and install the following:

        * Ubuntu 24.04 (the latest version)
        * Jenkins
        * Docker
        * SonarQube Docker Container
        * eksctl
        * aws CLI
        * kubectl
        * node_exporter
        * trivy scanner
        * gitleaks

    - [x] Output the `Public IP address` and the `SSH connection string` for the newly provisioned Jenkins server  
    - [x] The terraform script will also be used to `destroy` the server and its resources during the clean-up stage of this project.

    !!! warning "Important Security Note"
        Since this is just a demo project, the ports are deliberately exposed and may be accessible over the internet for the duration of the project demonstration. ==This is not a good security practice in production environments and should be avoided :smile:==

Clone the Repo on your local machine and apply the terraform config:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/opeyemitechpro/Terraform-Jenkins-CICD.git
```

``` sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Ater the terraform script executes, it displays the `Public IP Address` and the `SSH Connection string` of the Jenkins Server in the format below:

`ssh -i <Key-pair_filename> ubuntu@<Jenkins_Master_public_ip>`

    ///


Use the `Public IP address` to access the Jenkins server initial setup UI from your browser on port `8080`.

`<server_public_ip>:8080`

Also, open the terraform working folder from a terminal and use the `SSH connection string` to access the jenkins server.

``` sh 
ssh -i `key_pair_filename` ubuntu@`<server_public_ip>`
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    Replace the `key_pair_filename` and the `server_public_ip` as appropriate

#### Login to Jenkins Server

Go back to the Jenkins server terminal to copy the initial Admin password

From the jenkins server terminal, enter the command and copy the password displayed
``` sh
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

From the Jenkins server initial setup UI page in your browser, enter the jenkins initial admin password you copied to proceed with jenkins server setup.

Install the `Suggested Plugins` and login to the Jenkins Server as Admin

Install suggested Jenkins Plugins and login as admin

#### Configure Plugins

### :simple-sonarqubeserver: Configure SonarQube Server

Next, let us setup our SonarQube server.  For this project, our SonarQube server is installed as a docker container running on the same server as our Jenkins server.

From your browser, login to your **SonarQube server** using the  server ip and port `9000` 

Server URL: `<sonar_server_ip>:9000`

!!! tip "Tip"
    
    Since our SonarQube server is running as a docker container on port `9000` on the same machine as the Jenkins server, use `<jenkins_server_ip>:9000` as the SonarQube Server URL.

Create a User token by going to `Administration > Security > Users` and save it somewhere for later

This token will be used to authenticate Jenkins to access the SonarQube server.

??? image "Image - Generate SonarQube token on the SonarQube server"

---

Then, on your Jenkins server, go to `Manage Jenkins > Tools` and configure each of the plugin tools as explained below: 

**SonarQube Scanner Installations**

Go to `Manage Jenkins` :material-arrow-right: `Tools` :material-arrow-right: `SonarQube Scanner installations` and add a new SonarQube Scanner installation as below:

- [x] SonarQube Scanner: `sonar-scanner` (Or use a suitable name)

!!! tip "Tip"
    This name will be used later in our CI pipeline to reference the sonar tool installation so ensure you choose a unique name.

- [x] Leave the default SonarQube version as it is


Set the SonarQube server URL under `Manage Jenkins > System > SonarQube Installations`

- Server Name: `sonar` _(This name will be used later in the job pipeline)_

- Server URL: `http://<sonar_server_ip>:9000` _(URL of the SonarQube server on port 9000)_

- Server authentication token: Select the `sonar token ID` saved earlier in the credentials tab

- `Apply` and `Save`

??? image "Image - SonarQube Scanner Tool Installation"


---

**Docker**

On your Jenkins server, go to `Manage Jenkins > Tools > Docker installations` and add a new docker installation

Docker Name: `docker`

Set to `Install Automatically from docker.com`

Click `Apply` and `Save`

---

Go to `Manage Jenkins > System` and configure the following settings:

System Admin e-mail address: `Jenkins Admin <your-email@email.com>` 
_(Enter the Jenkins Admin email here, this will appear in the email sender field of your inbox)_


---

**SonarQube servers**

Name: `sonar` _(This name will be used later in the pipeline)_

Server URL: `<sonar_server_ip:9000>` _(This should be the ip address of the SonarQube server on port `9000` which in our case, is also the same as our Jenkins server ip address)_

Server Authentication token: `sonar-token`


---

**Declarative Pipeline (Docker)**

Docker Label: `docker`

---

**Prometheus**

No further configuration needed

By default, the Prometheus metrics will be scrapped from `http://<jenkins_server_ip:8080>/prometheus`

---

**Jenkins Email Notifications**

Goto `Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > System` and configure both the __"Extended E-mail Notification"__ and the __"E-mail Notification"__ sections as below:

- [x] SMTP Server Name: `smtp.gmail.com`
- [x] SMTP Port:  `465`
- [x] Username:    `user_email_id@gmail.com`
- [x] Password: `app_password`
- [x] Use SSL: `checked`
- [x] System Admin e-mail address: `<Admin_Name> <user_email_id@gmail.com>`
- [x] Default Content Type: `HTML`
- [x] Test email delivery


!!! tip "Tip"

    - The settings above apply to Gmail address configuration. Confirm SMTP settings from your email service provider if different from Gmail.
    - Copy `App password` from your Gmail account security settings and use that as the password in the above configuration.

---

**Default Content Type**

Set to `HTML (text/html)`

---

Click `Save` to close the configurations page

---

### :simple-jenkins: **Setting Up the Jenkins Pipelines**

For this project we will set up 2 separate pipelines.

1. **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline** - This pipeline will be responsible for building, testing, scanning and pushing the docker images to Docker Hub
2. **Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipeline** - This pipeline will be responsible for updating the k8s manifest file in the GitHub repo with the new docker image tags pushed by the CI pipeline

#### Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

- Go to `Jenkins > Create a Job` and give the new job item a name

- Select `Pipeline` and click `OK`

??? image "Image - Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job"



Go to `the_job_name > Configuration > Pipeline` and select `Pipeline script`

Copy and paste the CI pipeline script in the annotation box below into the Jenkins pipeline script template box.

Click `Save`

Below is the Jenkins pipeline script for the `Continous Integration (CI)`.

I have include details on how this pipeline script works in the annotation box below.

    ??? note "How This Jenkins Pipeline Script Works"

        Below is a breif description of how this jenkins CI pipeline script works

        This Jenkins pipeline automates the entire CI workflow for the 11-microservices Kubernetes application. It takes care of pulling the source code, scanning for security issues, analyzing code quality, building Docker images for each microservice, pushing them to Docker Hub, and finally updating the Kubernetes manifests with the new image tags. Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:
        
        * Environment Setup - The pipeline defines environment variables for Git, Docker, SonarQube, Trivy, Gitleaks, and email notifications. These variables let Jenkins know where to pull code from, where to push images, and how to connect with external tools like SonarQube or Docker Hub. The Docker image tag is dynamically generated from the Jenkins build number (e.g. ver-23).

        * Workspace Preparation - The pipeline starts with Clean Workspace, which clears out any old files or artifacts from previous builds. This ensures that every run starts fresh and avoids conflicts.

        * Source Code Checkout - Jenkins pulls the application code from the configured GitHub branch (OpeyemiTechPro-v1) to the workspace, making it ready for scanning and builds.

        * Security & Quality Scans

            * Gitleaks Scan: Detects any hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) in the repository.

            * SonarQube Analysis: Runs static code analysis for code quality, bugs, and maintainability issues.

            * Trivy FS Scan: Scans the projectâ€™s filesystem for known vulnerabilities before building the Docker images.

        * Docker Image Build & Push - Each microservice (adservice, cartservice, checkoutservice, etc.) has its own build stage. Jenkins Switches into each of the microservice directory, builds a Docker image tagged with the current build version, pushes the image to Docker Hub using stored credentials and this process is repeated for all 11 microservices, ensuring they are all containerized and versioned consistently.

        * Docker Image Cleanup - Once the images are pushed to Docker Hub, Jenkins cleans up local images to free up space on the build server to avoid taking up unneccessary space on the Jenkins server

        * Update Kubernetes Manifest - Instead of deploying directly, the pipeline triggers a separate Jenkins job called `Update-Manifest`. The `Update-Manifest` job updates the Kubernetes deployment manifests with the newly built Docker tags, ensuring that the cluster always runs the latest version of the services.

        * Post-Build Notifications - Regardless of success or failure, Jenkins sends an email notification with build details, logs, and scan reports (Trivy, Gitleaks, dependency-check). This gives visibility into what happened during the pipeline run.

        âœ… In summary: This pipeline performs code checkout â†’ security scans â†’ code quality analysis â†’ Docker builds â†’ image push â†’ Kubernetes manifest update â†’ email notifications.

        It enforces DevSecOps best practices while automating the entire CI/CD workflow for the microservices app on Kubernetes.


#### Configure GitHub Webhook

To enable Github to automatically trigger the Jenkins CI pipeline anytime a change is pushed to this GitHub repo, we need to configure a webhook in GitHub. The webhook sends a signal to this Jenkins job whenever the repo is updated. This causes the Jenkins CI pipeline to run without human intervention.

- On the Github repo for this application, go to `Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook`
- Payload URL: `http://<jenkins_server_ip>:8080/github-webhook/` _(Replace `<jenkins_server_ip>` with the actual IP address of your Jenkins server)_
- Content type: `application/json`
- Secret: Leave blank
- Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? `Just the push event`
- Active: `Checked`
- Click `Add webhook`

#### **Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipeline**

- Go to `Jenkins > Create a Job` and create a second job item

- Name the job `Update-Manifest`

!!! tip "Tip"
    It is important that the pipeline must be named `Update-Manifest` because this will be referenced by the CI pipeline script we created earlier. If you choose to use a different name, ensure you modify your CI pipeline script to reflect that.


- Select `Pipeline` and click `OK`

Go to `Update-Manifest > Configuration > Pipeline` and select `Pipeline script`

Copy and paste the CD pipeline script below into the script template box.

Click `Save`

Below is the Jenkins pipeline script for the `Continous Deployment (CD)`.

I have also included details on how this pipeline script works in the annotation box below.

    ??? note "How This Jenkins CD Pipeline Script Works"
        
        This Jenkins pipeline is responsible for automatically updating the Kubernetes ArgoCD manifest whenever new Docker images are built and pushed by the main CI pipeline. Instead of manually editing YAML files to change image tags, this job updates the manifest with the latest Docker tag and pushes the change back to GitHub so ArgoCD can sync and deploy it.

        Hereâ€™s how it works:

        - Pipeline Setup - The pipeline defines key environment variables like GitHub credentials, Docker Hub username, commit author details, and email addresses for notifications.
        It also accepts a parameter (DOCKER_TAG) from the upstream build job (the CI pipeline) so that the manifest is updated with the exact version of the new Docker images.

        - Git Checkout - Jenkins checks out the ArgoCD manifest repository (11-Microservices-k8s-App-ArgoCD) from GitHub on the specified branch (main). This repo contains the Kubernetes deployment YAML that ArgoCD watches.

        - Update Manifest with New Docker Tag - Before making changes, the script prints out the current image: lines from the manifest file for visibility. It then uses a `sed` command with regex to find all Docker image references (e.g., opeyemitechpro/service:oldtag) and replace the old tag with the new tag (DOCKER_TAG). After replacement, it prints the updated image: lines so you can verify the changes directly in the Jenkins logs.

        - Commit & Push Changes - The pipeline configures Git with the commit author and email set in the environment variables. It stages and commits the updated manifest file with a message showing which build triggered the update. Using the stored GitHub credentials, it pushes the updated manifest back to the main branch of the repository.

        - If no changes were required (for example, if the manifest already had the latest tag), the commit step is skipped gracefully.

        - Post-Build Notification - Once finished, Jenkins sends an email notification with details of the build (status, job URL, build number, and the new Docker tag). This ensures visibility of every manifest update.

        âœ… In summary: This pipeline takes the Docker tag produced by the CI job, updates all microservice image tags in the ArgoCD manifest, commits the changes to GitHub, and lets ArgoCD handle the deployment. It removes the need for manual edits, keeps deployments consistent, and fully automates the CD process for Kubernetes microservices.

## Kubernetes Cluster Setup 

For this project, we will use a basic Kubernetes cluster hosted on Amazon EKS. Our application will be deployed to the EKS cluster using ArgoCD. Additionally, we will deploy Prometheus and Grafana on the same cluster to monitor both our application and underlying infrastructure. We will use Helm to install ArgoCD and the Prometheus stack on the cluster.

For simplicity, we will use our Jenkins server as the base server to manage the EKS cluster.

To enable this, we will create IAM policies and attach it to the Jenkins instance, granting it the necessary permissions to manage our Amazon EKS cluster. 

See [_(AWS Documentation - How to create IAM Policies)_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html){: target="_blank" }

#### AWS IAM Policies required for EKS Cluster Creation

The following AWS IAM policies are required to create and manage an EKS cluster. Ensure that the IAM role or user associated with your Jenkins server has these policies attached:

- [x] AmazonEC2FullAccess
- [x] AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy
- [x] AmazonEKSClusterPolicy
- [x] AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy
- [x] AWSCloudFormationFullAccess
- [x] IAMFullAccess
- [x] Custom-EKS_Full_Access _(create an additional custom policy as shown below)_

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Statement1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"eks:*"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

See [_(AWS Docmentation - Minimum IAM Policies for EKS)_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/eksctl/minimum-iam-policies.html){: target="_blank" }

Create the IAM user and attach the required policies to the user. Under the user's `Security Credentials` tab,  `create access key` for the user and enable `CLI Use Case`. Copy both the `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` and store it somewhere for the next step.

From your jenkins terminal, configure your AWS credentials using the command below:

``` sh
aws configure  
```
Enter the `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` you copied earlier and set the default region (in my case its `us-east-2`)

Now, our Jenkins server now has the neccesary permissions to create our EKS cluster.

### Create EKS Cluster

Create your EKS Cluster

!!! tip inline end "Tip"

    - Replace the cluster name and region in the command with your desired values

``` sh hl_lines="2"
eksctl create cluster \
  --name opeyemi-k8s-cluster \
  --region us-east-2  
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    - [x] This command will create an EKS cluster named `opeyemi-k8s-cluster` in the `us-east-2` region. You can change these values as needed.
    - [x] The command will also create a default node group with t3.medium instances. You can customize the node group settings by adding additional flags to the command. See [_(eksctl documentation - create cluster)_](https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/#creating-a-cluster){: target="_blank" }

### :simple-helm: Install Helm

Check if Helm is installed on your base server

``` sh
helm version
```

If not, install Helm with this command

``` sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

---


### :simple-argo: ArgoCD Installation

Add ArgoCD Helm repo

``` sh
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update
```

Install ArgoCD Helm Chart

``` sh
helm install opeyemi-argo-cd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd --create-namespace
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    This will name the release `opeyemi-argo-cd` and create the `argocd` namespace if it doesn't exist then install ArgoCD in the `argocd` namespace.



??? tip "Optional Steps to confirm the `argocd` installation"
    View helm releases in all namespaces (including the `argocd` namespace)
    
    ``` sh
    helm list -n argocd
    ```

    Check running status of pods in the `argocd` namespace to verify deployment

    ``` sh
    kubectl get pods -n argocd
    ```

    Get Helm release notes for the argocd installation

    ``` sh
    helm get notes opeyemi-argo-cd -n argocd
    ```

Expose the `argocd-server` service as a LoadBalancer

By default all the pods in the `argocd` namespace are of `ClusterIP` type. We need to expose the `argocd-server` service as a LoadBalancer service type to make it accessible from outside the cluster.

First, display list of services running in the argocd namespace

``` sh
kubectl get svc -n argocd
```

Next, expose the `opeyemi-argo-cd-argocd-server` service as a LoadBalancer type

``` sh
kubectl patch svc opeyemi-argo-cd-argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    You will need to wait a short while for LoadBalancer URL to become ready before you can access it in the browser.

You can retrieve the LoadBalancer URL with:

``` sh
kubectl get svc -n argocd
```
OR use 
``` sh
kubectl get svc opeyemi-argo-cd-argocd-server -n argocd -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
```

Use this LoadBalancer URL to access ArgoCD UI from your browser.

The initial password for the `admin` account is auto-generated and stored in the field `password` in a secret named `argocd-initial-admin-secret` in your Argo CD installation namespace. You can simply retrieve this password using kubectl:


??? warning inline end "Warning"

    In Production, You should delete the `argocd-initial-admin-secret` from the Argo CD namespace once you change the password. The secret serves no other purpose than to store the initially generated password in clear and can safely be deleted at any time. It will be re-created on demand by Argo CD if a new admin password must be re-generated. 
    
    [Learn more :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#4-login-using-the-cli){: target="_blank" }

``` sh
kubectl get secrets -n argocd
```
OR use

``` sh
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
```

??? tip "Accessing initial ArgoCD Admin password"
    Alternatively, you could access the ArgoCD initial Admin password by first displaying the contents of the `argocd-initial-admin-secret` then base64 decode the password field as shown below:

    ``` sh
    kubectl get secrets argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd
    ```

    ``` sh
    echo "<initial-password-string>" | base64 -d
    ```

## Set Up Monitoring Using Prometheus and Grafana

## :simple-prometheus: Prometheus Stack Installation and Setup on EKS using Helm

Add the kube-prometheus-stack Helm repo

``` sh
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Install Prometheus Stack into `monitoring` namespace


``` sh
helm install opeyemi-prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --create-namespace
```

??? code-file "==Delete this later=="
    ``` sh
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
    --namespace monitoring \
    --create-namespace \
    --set prometheus.prometheusSpec.maximumStartupDurationSeconds=300 \
    --set alertmanager.persistence.storageClass="gp2" \
    --set server.persistentVolume.storageClass="gp2"
    ```


!!! tip "Tip"

    This will create the `monitoring` namespace if it doesn't exist already and deploy the full Prometheus monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager + exporters) into the `monitoring` namespace

Check running status of pods in the `monitoring` namespace to verify deployment

``` sh
kubectl --namespace monitoring get pods -l "release=opeyemi-prometheus"
```

OR
``` sh
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

??? note "Optionally you can display helm release notes for the Prometheus installation"
    ``` sh
    helm get notes opeyemi-prometheus -n monitoring
    ```

Expose Prometheus and Grafana as a LoadBalancer type to access

By default all the pods in the `monitoring`  namespace are of `ClusterIP` type. We need to expose Grafana and Prometheus services as LoadBalancer service types to make them accessible from outside the cluster.

First list all services in the monitoring namespace

``` sh
kubectl get svc -n monitoring
```

??? code-file "==Delete Later=="
    Display Grafana URL (optional)
    ``` sh
    kubectl get svc -n monitoring prometheus-grafana
    ```

    Display Prometheus URL (optional)
    ``` sh
    kubectl get svc -n monitoring prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus
    ``` 


Expose Grafana as a LoadBalancer for external access

``` sh
kubectl patch svc prometheus-grafana \
  -n monitoring \
  -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

Expose Prometheus as a LoadBalancer for external access

``` sh
kubectl patch svc prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus \
  -n monitoring \
  -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

Display list of all the services in the `monitoring` namespace again. AWS would create LoadBalancer URLs for each of Grafana and Prometheus

``` sh
kubectl get svc -n monitoring
```

!!! tip "Tip"

    You may need to wait a while for the `EXTERNAL-IP` field to be populated, then open each URL for both Grafana and Prometheus in your browser (Grafana on port `80`, Prometheus on port `9090`)


To get Grafana password, enter the command below. This will display the contents of the `prometheus-grafana` secret in json format. Copy the `admin-password` from the json output and decode it in base-64

``` sh
kubectl get secrets -n monitoring
```

``` sh
kubectl --namespace monitoring get secrets prometheus-grafana -o json 
```


``` sh
echo "<admin-password>" | base64 --decode

```

!!! tip "Tip"

    Replace the `<admin-password>` with the password string you copied from the json output


OR use this command

``` sh
kubectl --namespace monitoring get secrets prometheus-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 -d ; echo
```

!!! tip "Tip"

    - Default Grafana Username is `admin`
    - The decoded password should translate to `prom-operator` which is the default grafana password.

## Scrapping Additional Metrics

In order to monitor our Jenkins Server on the Grafana Dashboard, we need to expose the metrics to prometheus using `node_exporter` and `prometheus plugin`. Earlier, we had installed `node_exporter` on our Jenkins server using the bash script and we have also installed the `prometheus plugin` on Jenkins. The `node_exporter` will expose the server metrics while the `prometheus plugin` will expose metrics from Jenkins itself.

âœ… **Prerequisites:**
- [x] Prometheus is installed on kubernetes cluster via Helm chart.
- [x] Node_exporter is running and accessible on our Jenkins server (default port: `9100`).
- [x] The Jenkins server's IP address is publicly accessible or reachable from within the EKS cluster (e.g., via VPC Peering, VPN, or internal networking).
- [x] Security Groups and firewall rules allow traffic from EKS nodes to port `9100` on the Jenkins server.

### ðŸš€ Steps to Add Jenkins Server to Prometheus Scrape Targets

#### 1. Create Additional Scrape Config via Secret

Create a file named `additional-scrape-configs.yaml` with the following content:

!!! code-file "additional-scrape-configs.yaml"

    ``` yaml hl_lines="3 12"
    - job_name: 'jenkins-node-exporter'
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['<server_ip>:9100']
        labels:
            instance: 'instance_name'
            role: 'node-exporter'
            environment: 'dev'

    - job_name: 'jenkins-prom-plugin'
    metrics_path: /prometheus
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['<server_ip>:8080']
        labels:
            instance: 'instance_name'
            role: 'jenkins-master'
            environment: 'dev'

    ```

!!! tip "Tip"

    Edit the higlighted lines above and replace `<server-ip>` with the IP address of the Jenkins server. 


#### 2. Now create a Kubernetes secret

``` sh
kubectl create secret generic additional-scrape-configs \
  --from-file=additional-scrape-configs.yaml \
  -n monitoring

```

#### 3. Edit Prometheus Custom Resource

First get the prometheus resource name

``` sh
kubectl get prometheus -n monitoring
```

Then edit the prometheus custom resource

``` sh
kubectl edit prometheus prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus -n monitoring
```

Under `spec` add:

``` yaml
  additionalScrapeConfigs:
    name: additional-scrape-configs
    key: additional-scrape-configs.yaml
```

So the result should look like this:

``` yaml
spec:
  ...
  additionalScrapeConfigs:
    name: additional-scrape-configs
    key: additional-scrape-configs.yaml
```

#### 4. Apply and Verify

Prometheus will reload its config automatically by deafult. Wait a minute, then:

* Go to the Prometheus UI (`/targets` page).
* Look for the job `node-exporter-standalone`.
* Ensure itâ€™s marked as UP.

## Clean-Up 

To avoid incurring uneccessary costs, it is advisable to clean up (destroy) all the infrastructural resources created during this project.

First, from the Jenkins server terminal, lets uninstall the Helm releases:

Uninstall ArgoCD and the kube-Prometheus stack

``` sh
helm uninstall opeyemi-argo-cd --n argocd
kubectl delete namespace argocd
helm uninstall opeyemi-prometheus --n monitoring 
kubectl delete namespace monitoring
```

Delete the EKS Cluster along with all other cluster resources

``` sh
eksctl delete cluster --name opeyemi-k8s-cluster --region us-east-2

Then delete the Jenkins server from your local machine which we created using terraform.

From your local machine, navigate to the directory where your Terraform working folder and run this command:

``` sh
terraform destroy

## **Conclusion**

This hands-on DevSecOps project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a modern cloud-native application â€” from automated provisioning to deployment, security, and monitoring â€” all powered by open-source tooling and AWS infrastructure. By integrating Terraform, Jenkins, SonarQube, Trivy, Gitleaks, ArgoCD, Prometheus, and Grafana, the project showcases how DevOps and security principles can be unified to deliver a production-ready, observable, and continuously improving system. 

The end result is not just an 11-microservice e-commerce application running on EKS, but a replicable blueprint for building secure, automated, and scalable DevSecOps pipelines in any enterprise environment. This project underscores one key truth: **automation, visibility, and security are not optional in modern software delivery â€” they are the foundation of resilience and innovation.**
