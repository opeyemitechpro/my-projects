## Search: better, faster, smaller

__This is the story of how we managed to completely rebuild client-side search,
delivering a significantly better user experience while making it faster and
smaller at the same time.__

The [search] of Material for MkDocs is by far one of its best and most-loved
assets: [multilingual], [offline-capable], and most importantly: _all
client-side_. It provides a solution to empower the users of your documentation
to find what they're searching for instantly without the headache of managing
additional servers. However, even though several iterations have been made,
there's still some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search
plugin and integration from the ground up. This article shines some light on the
internals of the new search, why it's much more powerful than the previous
version, and what's about to come.

_The next section discusses the architecture and issues of the current search
implementation. If you immediately want to learn what's new, skip to the
