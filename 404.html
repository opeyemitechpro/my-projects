## 🛠 Possible Causes:
- Someone ran `terraform destroy` a little too confidently.  
- This pod was evicted due to low CPU… and bad karma.  
- The YAML gods were displeased with your indentation.  
- The S3 bucket was public and then mysteriously emptied.  
- Your request went into a VPC with no Internet Gateway.

## ☁️ Debugging Commands:
```bash
kubectl get pages -n internet
# No resources found in internet namespace
```
